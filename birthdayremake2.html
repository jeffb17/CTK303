            <p>"Baby Boy" is a song by American singer Beyoncé, featuring Jamaican rapper Sean Paul, from her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). It was also included on the reissue of Paul's second album, Dutty Rock (2002). Both Beyoncé and Paul co-wrote the song with Robert Waller, Jay-Z, and Scott Storch, who produced it with Beyoncé.</p>
            <p>When I was doing my research, I was struggling to find results from past results. I was also a tad bit confused on whether it meant our birth year or any way. Luckily, on my first search, I found a song I knew and really enjoyed. I had heard this song many times while riding in the car with my mom, at family events, and more. It's crazy how it was #1 on my birthday.</p>
