                Bloodline Business is a family-oriented brand starting with myself Jeff Bowens, Illinois State cornernack, helping my young cousins from Detroit, MI excel and pave a path for them to be great and get to the next level.
            </h1>

            
                    <h2> Who's In the Bloodline?</h2>

            <div class="info"></div>
            <p>
                Left- Ayden Bowens("AB") WR/S  Right- Shammon Beavers("QB1") QB/S
            </p>

            <h3> AB</h3>
            <img src="cuzab3.JPG">
            <p>
               Ayden just turned 12 and this past year has dominated the 11U level. He stands at about 5'6 105lbs.
               He plays with that height to his advantage at WR going up over smaller defenders "mossing" them weekly. When I talk to others at home some refer to him as "Man Child" or "Baby Megatron" because of the plays he's made.
               Not to mention him coming downhill with hitsticks on defense from his saftey postion.
            </p>


            <h4> QB1</h4>
            <img src="QB1pic.jpeg">
            <p>
               Shammon is a year younger just turning 11 before a almost season injury this season to his throwing arm, he torched defenses and led his team to success. What stands out most with Shammon is his descion making and IQ of the game which you love from your QB, he knows how to get the ball to his playmakers quick and on target.
               This season he returned late from injury and led his team to the playoofs before utilmaley coming up short. Same way he controls and manages the game on offense he does the same when hoverig over everyone at his free saftey postion.
            </p>

               Lastly  Jeff Bowens the oldest and the face of the group. Having the most expereince and providing guidence for my younger family. A D1 cornerback at Illinois State totaling 40 tackles 3 PBU's and 1 INT this season going into his final season.
